# üîé Supercharge Your AI with Web Search Powers

**Save Cursor/Windsurf credits and pay cash instead (it's worth it!)**

Want to give your AI coder the power to search the web without going broke?

That's why I built **4o-mini-search** MCP Server.

And the best thing is, it's super easy to use!

## ‚ú® What This Does For You

You can search the web through OpenAI's **4o-mini Search** model.

It basically crawls the web, and gives you (or your AI coder) a super helpful answer.

- **Get Docs**: Read the latest docs without searching/copy/pasting
- **Save Money**: Pay just 1-3 cents per search instead of wasting credits.
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Works right out of the box thanks to a simple `npx` command.
- **Super Compatible**: Works seamlessly with Claude, Cursor AI, and other popular MCP clients
- **Flexible APIs**: Use with either OpenAI directly, or OpenRouter.ai!

## üöÄ Quick Start

Could not be easier, all you have to do is add it to your MCP JSON config file.

If you don't know what it is, just give it a quick search like [this one][https://www.google.com/search?q=mcp+setup+cursor+ai].

## üîß Setting Up With Claude, Cusor & Co

Just copy the configuration below, and that's it.

Your AI can now search the web at a fraction of the cost!

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "4o-mini-search": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@rebers/4o-mini-search-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "your-api-key",
        "PROVIDER": "openai"  // or "openrouter"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

2. Replace `your-api-key` with your actual API key
3. Add to your configuration file
4. Restart your AI application

## üí° Using Your New Search Power

Once set up, simply ask your AI to search something.

> "search mcp for latest 3.7 model and how to use it with node sdk"
> 
> "search mcp for how nextjs app router works exactly and how to use it"
> 
> "search mcp for for the latest sveltekit templates"

It will then use OpenAI's **4o-mini-search** and deliver fresh information directly to your AI's context!

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Server not connecting in Cursor AI
**Fix**: After saving configuration, restart Cursor completely and try again.
